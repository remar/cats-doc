Cats - C# Abstraction for Tiles and Sprites
===========================================

Cats is an abstraction for working with 2D graphics (tiles and
sprites). This project contains the general documentation and actual
implementations will be contained in their own repositories.

In general, my aim is to make a very competetent 2D graphics engine
on top of SDL2.
